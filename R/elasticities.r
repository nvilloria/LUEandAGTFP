#' Elasticity of cropland to changes in agricultural Total Factor
#' Productivity (TFP)
#'
#' A dataset containing the domestic and bilateral elasticities of
#' cropland to changes in agricultural TFP for 86 countries.  These
#' elasticities are from Villoria (2019).  The elasticities were
#' estimated using average rates of change in cropland area and TFP
#' (Fuglie, 2017) for the two periods of 1991-2000 and 2001-2010,
#' along with data on trade flows and costs, to identify country-level
#' responses of cropland area to TFP in each country. Estimates were
#' made using a sample of 70 countries with sufficient data,
#' comprising 74% of global cropland and 91% of global production and
#' exports.  Here we utilize the OLS values to provide conservative
#' estimates of the area responses to TFP (see Villoria 2019).  We
#' extend the country coverage of the elasticities in Villoria (2019)
#' by bringing 16 additional countries with enough data on production
#' and trade that can be combined with original parameter
#' estimates. The final 86 countries comprise 87% of global cropland,
#' 96% of global production, 93% of global imports, and 97% of global
#' exports. We include the elasticities for 2001-2010 only. The
#' variables are as follows:

#'   \item{e.ik}{% change in cropland_k / % change in TFP_i. For
#' domestic elasticities, i = k.}  }
