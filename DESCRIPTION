Description: A companion to Lobell David B. and Nelson B. Villoria (2022) article tentatively titled "Accounting for land use spillovers can greatly reduce the benefits of some climate-smart agricultural policies" and still in progress. The functions combine estimates of links between total factor productivity (TFP) and cropland use in each country [from Villoria AJAE]] with estimates of carbon emissions for cropland expansion [From Roe et al.] to define TFP-emission links for each pair of countries. These estimates are then used to calculate the net impact of potential TFP changes on both domestic and global emissions.
